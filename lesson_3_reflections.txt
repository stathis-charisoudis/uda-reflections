When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  	when I want to share my project or thoughts with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there can be conflicts on files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branch local or remote commit when I want to fix something or experiment with an idea. 
	clone a repository to be able to work on my own copy even offline. 
	fork a repository is a github feature that gives the opportunity to find the original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It's easier to merge conflicts with the remote repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would have to set up a server to be able to share my project. It would be easier to collaborate with only myself but not with others ;-P
